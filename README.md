# PWM_arduino_gen
An example of using PWM pulses generated by Teensy (Arduino also works well) for generating an arbitrary waveform.
The figures below show a sine wave's output signal at 50 Hz, 100Hz, and 500Hz, respectively where a low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 800 Hz (R:200 ohm C: 10 microF) is used to average PWM signal.

The figure below shows the Teensy broad and low pass filter which is attached at the PWM output pin.
